# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Arwin, a web developer, software engineer, and Android developer based in Malaysia. You can check out my portfolio and projects on my [website](https://arwindpianist.github.io/). I'm currently pursuing a Diploma in ICT with a specialism in Software Engineering.

## About Me

I'm passionate about creating beautiful, functional, and innovative web and mobile app designs. I love the freedom that comes with creative design and the potential for software engineering to shape the digital world.

## Skills & Experience

I have experience working on small-scale web and mobile app development projects for local businesses, as well as developing websites and Android apps for my own services and e-commerce platforms. I'm well-versed in Java, Kotlin, Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, Vue.js, and Tailwind CSS. I'm always eager to learn new technologies and frameworks. I've also set up an AI system that keeps me updated on the latest news in the fields I'm interested in.

## Current Projects

I'm currently working on an e-commerce platform built with Vue.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. It's an exciting project that combines my passion for front-end development with creating a user-friendly online shopping experience. I'm also developing Android applications to complement the platform.

## Challenges & Solutions

One of the biggest challenges I face in my web and mobile app development projects is ensuring a seamless user experience while balancing creativity with practicality. However, clear communication with stakeholders and staying up to date with the latest trends and technologies have helped me find innovative solutions that meet the needs of all stakeholders involved.

## Tools & Resources

I primarily code using VSCode and use Git for version control and collaboration. I also use Codepen for collaboration and have learned a great deal from resources like W3Schools and YouTube.

## Favorite Projects

Some of my favorite projects include developing my own homeserver and pushing the boundaries of web development by participating in fun projects such as [DPI Tracer](https://github.com/Arwindpianist/dpi-tracer) and [Python Barcode Generator](https://github.com/Arwindpianist/barcode-generator).
